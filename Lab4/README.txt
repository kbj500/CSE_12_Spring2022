--------------
DESCRIPTION


This lab will develop a mini “Paint” application running on an emulated RISC-V computer. This application will take user input from the keyboard to draw patterns over a Bitmap display.


--------------
FILES


-
lab4_part1.asm
lab4_part2.asm

These file includes the assembly code of the lab. Part 1 writes a function that modifies and outputs the base address of the bitmap display according to a shift in x and y coordinates. Part 2 contains sections that modify x and y coordinates according to the kind of movement described in a given section ie. up, left, rightdown etc.


INSTRUCTIONS

This program is intended to be run using the RISCV Assembler and Runtime Simulator
(RARS). Connect the Bitmap and Keyboard tools to the lab4.asm file and run using RARS.
